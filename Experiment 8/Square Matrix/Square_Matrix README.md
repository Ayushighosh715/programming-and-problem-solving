## Problem Statement
Write a Python program to perform the multiplication of two square matrices. The program should take two matrices as input and output their product.

---

## Algorithm
1.Start

2.Input the order n of the square matrices.

3.Input elements of Matrix A and Matrix B.

4.Create a result matrix R of size n × n and initialize all elements to 0.

5.Initialize loop variable i from 0 to n−1.

6.Inside that, initialize loop variable j from 0 to n−1.

7.Inside that, initialize loop variable k from 0 to n−1.

8.Perform multiplication and addition:
  If inside loops →
    R[i][j] = R[i][j] + A[i][k] × B[k][j]

9.Repeat until all loops finish.

10.Print the result matrix R.

11.Stop.
